A new alternative method to access account without passwords. (Also combats keyloggers).
This project is aimed to enhance current techniques used to access secure accounts. While passwords are reliable they are easy to steal with malicious software and brute forcing. uSwipe is a new method of accessing this private information by using a unique pattern which you decide and can be unlimited characters long. Much simpler and easier to remember a 5 second pattern than a 20 character password.
